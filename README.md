## About
The OME Tiff Converter is a working prototype application for converting large-scale (gigapixel) 2D microscopy images from the raw data format output by the vendor to multiscale pyramidal OME-TIFF ([Open Microscopy Environment](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/)). It is aimed at simplifying and standardizing the file format and metadata with an intuititve and accesible GUI. The application and GUI are both developed in Python. Further support is needed to extend the capabilities of the application in the following ways.

1.  Reading multiple input formats from different microscope vendors.
2.  Writing multi-dimensional OME-TIFF files in an easy and transparent way.
3.  Editing and extending OME-TIFF metadata.
4.  Optimizing read/write file operations for faster processing of images.

These  upgrades  aim to make the  converter  suitable  for  use  by  a  wider group  of researchers in the field.
